    "text": "The file fsm.h implements a state machine for two communicating ports, Source and Sink. Each port has two states, empty or full. There are two transition events associated with the source: fill, which transitions from empty to full and tells the state machine there is an item in the Source, and and push, which initiates transfer to the Sink and transitions from full to empty.\nSimilarly, there are two events associated with the sink: drain, which transitions from full to empty and tells the Sink node that its item has been removed, and and pull, which attempts to transfer an item from the Source and transitions from empty to full. For simplicity, though we may need them in the future, we not consider events for startup, stop, forced shutdown, or abort.\nThe following diagram shows the state transitions for the port state machine. The state is represented with two bits, one for the source and one for the sink, e.g., “00” meaning that the source state is 0 and the sink state is 1.\n\n\nTo provide the functionality of the state machine for the purposes of safely transferring data from a Source to a Sink, there are exit and entry actions associated with selected states and events.\nOne particular aspect of this is the pull event from state 00 and the push event from state 11. In these cases, the exit action is “wait”, since the only valid state to complete a push or a pull is from state 01. Accordingly, we perform notifications as entry actions to state 10.\nWhen a source or sink thread is released from its wait, it is still in the push or pull event. To enable it to complete that desired operation, we restart the event processing for the push or pull event in the current state.\n(As a slight optimization, we also perform notifications on entry to states 00 and 11. The waiter doesn’t get to move in that case, but does get to leave the wait and produce or consume an item and then try to push or pull again.)\nOur basic goal for the Source and Sink ports is to transfer a data item from a Source to a connected (bound) Sink. At a high level, the way a client would use the Source to do this is the following: - create a data item - insert the data item into a Source port - invoke the fill event - invoke the push event\nSimilarly, the desired usage of a Sink port is also to transfer a data item from a Source to a bound Sink. At a high level, the way a client would use the Source is the following - invoke the pull event - extract the data item from the Sink port - consume the item - invoke the drain event\nBased on these product states and the four above events, the state transition table for the product state machine (which we will just refer to as the “state machine” below is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill\npush\ndrain\npull\nstop\n\n\n00\n10\n00\n\n01\n\n\n\n01\n11\n01\n00\n01\n\n\n\n10\n\n01\n\n01\n\n\n\n11\n\n01\n10\n11\n\n\n\n\nUsing this table, we can include the states as predicates to create an initial “proof outline” statements for the Source operation:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∨ state = 01 } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n     do produce and insert item\n     /* { state = 00 ∨ state = 01 } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     do fill\n     /* { state = 10 ∨ state = 11 } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     do push\n     /* { state = 00 ∨ state = 01 } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n   }\nSimilarly for Sink:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∨ state = 10 } ∧ { sink_item = empty } */\n     do pull\n     /* { state = 01 ∨ state = 11 } ∧ { sink_item = full } */\n     do extract and consume item  \n     /* { state = 01 ∨ state = 11 } ∧ { sink_item = full } */\n     do drain\n     /* { state = 00 ∨ state = 10 } ∧ { sink_item = empty } */\n   }\nNow, the Source and Sink need to coordinate push and pull so there is not a race condition (nor a deadlock) when making transitions in the state machine. Moreover, we have to make sensible transitions. That is, we only be able to succesfully do a push when the Sink state is empty (and the Sink item itself is empty). This is why we insert a new item and then invoke fill. Until the state has transitioned to indicate the state of the Source is full, the Sink will not attempt to transfer the item. Similarly, we empty the sink_item and then signal that the Sink is in the empty state.\nTo do this, we associate exit and entry actions with each state transition, some of which will synchronize between Source and Sink. These actions are used with the state transition thusly:\n\nbegin_transition: given old_state and event\nexecute exit(old_state, event)\nnew_state = transition(old_state, event)\nexecute entry(new_state, event)\n\nNote that the exit action is called before the state transition. Note also that the entry action is called with the new state (the post transition state).\nThe tables for exit actions to be perfomed on state transitions is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill\npush\ndrain\npull\nstop\n\n\n00\n\nreturn\n\nsink_wait\n\n\n\n01\n\nreturn\n\nreturn\n\n\n\n10\n\nsource_swap\n\nsink_swap\n\n\n\n11\n\nsource_wait\n\nreturn\n\n\n\n\nThe table for entry actions to be performend on state transitions is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill\npush\ndrain\npull\nshutdown\n\n\n00\n\n\nnotify_source\n\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\nnotify_sink\n\nnotify_source\n\n\n\n\n11\nnotify_sink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source_swap function is used to potentially transfer the data items associated with Source and Sink from the Source to the Sink (as well as changing the state if data transfer is carried out). The source_swap function is invoked whenever the state is 10 (which is when there is an item in Source and space available to transfer to the Sink. The data transfer is carried out by swapping the Source and Sink items and changing the state of 10 to 01.\nWhen the state is 00, the Sink will wait for the Source to become full. The Source will notify the Sink when it becomes full. Similarly, if the state is 11, the Source will wait until it is signalled by the Sink that the Sink is empty.\n\n\nTo prove correctness of the port state machine, we use proof outline techniques from e.g., Concurrent Programming by Greg Andrews. For this proof outline, we represent the overall state of a connected Source and Sink with two boolean arrays, each with two elements, shared by the Source and Sink: state and items.\n\n\nFor the purposes of a proof outline, the Source has three operations:\n1. inject: items[0] ← 1\n2. fill: state[0] ← 1\n3. push: 〈 await ¬{ state = 11 } :\n            if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\nSimilarly, for the purposes of a proof outline, the Sink has three operations:\n1. extract: item[1] ← 0\n2. drain: state[1] ← 0\n3. pull: 〈 await ¬{ state = 00 } :\n            if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\n\n\n\nThe critical operation of the Source is the push, which blocks (awaits) until ¬{ state = 11 }, that is, until the state is not equal to 11. In that case, states 00, 01, and 10 could pass through. However, in addition to the await, push includes a data transfer step (a “move”) that will perform the following predicate transformation for { state = 10 }:\n/* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } */\nThis represents moving a data item from the Source to the Sink. Note that both the state machine state and the actual data items being held are (atomically) changed in the move.\nBased on these properties of the push, we have the following valide states that can occur directly following a push:\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 }   */\nThe push itself is atomic, but as soon as it has completed, the state of the port can be changed by the Sink operating asynchronously to the Source. Given the three operations that the Sink can perform, the above states can be subject to pull, extract, or extract+drain. The pull operation will not change the state. The extract operation can change { items = 01 } to { items = 00 }. Similarly, drain can change { state = 01 } to { state = 00 }. Note that extract always precedes drain – the Sink cannot change { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } into { state = 00 ∧ items = 01 }.\nThus, the entire set of possible configurations following push are\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) }   */\nFollowing the push, the Source may inject, which will change the above states to:\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 11 ∨ items = 10 ) }   */\nAgain, the Sink may extract, drain, or pull. However, the only change that can occur is that extract may change { items = 11 } to { items = 10 }, which is already part of the above configuration. A subsequent drain may then change\n{ state = 01 ∧ items = 10 } to { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 }, which again, is already part of the above configuration. Thus, the Sink operating asynchronously will not change the system predicate between inject and fill. In other words, the sequence inject then fill can be considered to be atomic.\nFor the fill operation, the above predicate will be changed to\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ ( items = 11 ∨ items = 10 ) }   */\nAsynchronous operation of the Sink can change this predicate to\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) }   */\n\n\nThus, the proof outline for the Source is\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) }   */\n     inject: items[0] ← 1\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) }   */\n     fill: state[0] ← 1\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) }   */\n     push: 〈 await ¬{ state = 11 } :\n              if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) }   */     \n   }\n\n\n\n\nWe can follow a similar process to derive the proof outline for the Sink.\nThe critical operation of the Sink is the pull, which blocks (awaits) until ¬{ state = 00 }, that is, until the state is not equal to 00. In that case, states 01, 10, and 11 could pass through. However, in addition to the await, pull includes a data transfer step (a “move”) that will perform the following predicate transformation for { state = 10 }:\n/* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } */\nThis represents moving a data item from the Source to the Sink. Note that both the state machine state and the actual data items being held are (atomically) changed in the move.\nBased on these properties of the push, we have the following valide states that can occur directly following a push:\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }   */\nThe pull itself is atomic, but as soon as it has completed, the state of the port can be changed by the Source operating asynchronously to the Sink. Given the three operations that the Source can perform, the above states can be subject to push, inject, or inject+fill. The push operation will not change the predicate. The inject operation can change { items = 01 } to { items = 11 }. Similarly, fill can change { state = 01 } to { state = 11 }. Note that inject always precedes fill – the Source cannot change { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } into { state = 11 ∧ items = 01 }.\nThus, the entire set of possible configurations following push are\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }                    */\nFollowing the pull, the Sink may extract, which will change the above predicate to:\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ items = 10 }                    */\nAgain, the Source may inject, fill, or push. However, the only change that can occur is that inject may change { items = 00 } to { items = 10 }, which is already part of the above configuration. A subsequent fill may then change\n{ state = 01 ∧ items = 10 } to { state = 11 ∧ items = 10 }, which again, is already part of the above configuration. Thus, the Source operating asynchronously will not change the system predicate between extract and drain. In other words, the sequence extract then drain can be considered to be atomic.\nFor the drain operation, the above predicate will be changed to\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }                    */\nAsynchronous operation of the Source can change this predicate to\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }                  ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }                    */\n\n\nThus, the complete Sink proof outline iw\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }     */\n     pull: 〈 await ¬{ state = 00 } :\n              if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) }   */\n     extract: extract: item[1] ← 0\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 01 ) }   */\n     drain: state[1] ← 0  \n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) }   */\n   }\n\n\n\n\nThe proof outlines shows some important characteristics of the port state machine.\n\nIf we begin with the valid state { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } (which is the only sensible state with which to begin), the state machine will never enter any BAD state. We define a BAD state to be any of the following:\n\n\npredicate with { items = 10 ∨ items = 11 } prior to inject\npredicate with { state = 10 ∨ state = 11 } prior to fill\npredicate with { items = 00 ∨ items = 10 } prior to extract\npredicate with { state = 00 ∨ state = 10 } prior to drain\n\n\nIf we begin with the valid state { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 }, and use the following steps for the Source\n  inject\n  fill\n  push\nThe Source will always be ready to accept an item for injection. Hence we do not have to check whether the Source is ready prior to invoking inject. No concurrent Sink action will change the state into one that is BAD prior to inject.\nSimilarly, if we use the following steps for the Sink\n  pull\n  extract\n  drain\nThere will always be an item ready to extract after pull completes.\nThere are no race conditions between inject and fill, nor between extract and drain. Concurrent actions from the Sink cannot cause a BAD state between inject and fill, nor can concurrent actions from the Source introduce a BAD state between extract and drain.\nIn fact, there are no race conditions between any of the steps in the Source or the Sink. As a result, we do not need to introduce any locking mechanism to make any pairs of actions atomic. (As a reminder, all actions executed by the state machine are atomic.)\nOperations carried out directly by the state machine are protected by a lock. When the Source or Sink wait, they do so on a condition variable using that same lock. Note that when the Source and Sink both exit their loops that the Source will have { state = 00 ∨ state = 01 } while the Sink will have { state = 00 ∨ state = 10 }. The final state of the state machine is therefore { state = 00 ∨ state = 01 } ∧ { state = 00 ∨ state = 10 } ∧ { item = empty }, i.e., { state = 00 } ∧ { item = empty }. (This assumes that both Source and Sink perform the same number of operations, otherwise one of them will be left in a wait.)\nNB: The “move” portion of push and the “move” portion of pull (source_swap and sink_swap, respectively). Each checks to see if the state is equal to 10, if so, they swap the state to 01 (and perform a swap of the items associated with the source and sink), and notifies the other. If the state is not equal to 10, the swap function notifies the other and goes into a wait. Thus, we may not need separate swaps for Source and Sink, nor separate condition variables, nor separate notification functions. I have verified that this works experimentally, but I am leaving things separate for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor much of what TileDB will be doing with our task graph library, we will be using multi-stage edges between nodes. Edges, as they are currently implemented, still provide a control connection from the Sink to the Source connected by the Edge. In developing a proof outline for Source and Sink connected by an Edge with one (or more) buffered stages, we must account for the buffered data in both the state and the items.\nWe can follow a similar development for thi proof outline as we did for the unbuffered case.\nRevisiting the Source and Sink operations that we previously presented, we have the following actions for a three-stage port state machine:\n\n\n1. inject: items[0] ← 1\n2. fill: state[0] ← 1\n3. push: 〈 await ¬{ state = 111 } :\n            if { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 } → { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ⟩\n            if { state = 100 ∧ items = 100 } → { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ⟩\n            if { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 } → { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 } ⟩\n            if { state = 110 ∧ items = 110 } → { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 } ⟩\n\n\n\nSimilarly, for the purposes of a proof outline, the Sink has three operations:\n1. extract: item[2] ← 0\n2. drain: state[2] ← 0\n3. pull: 〈 await ¬{ state = 000 } :\n            if { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 } → { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ⟩\n            if { state = 100 ∧ items = 100 } → { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ⟩\n            if { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 } → { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 } ⟩\n            if { state = 110 ∧ items = 110 } → { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 } ⟩\n\n\n\nConsider first the effect of the push operation. Given the await condition, the state of the system must be ¬{ state = 111 }. Moreover, the push operation includes a “move” operation such that there are no “holes” in the data being transferred. That is, immediately after the (atomic) push operation completes, we have\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 }   */\nActions from the asynchronous Sink can then occur, i.e., an extract, drain, and/or pull.\nGiven the operations shown above, we can see that the predicate\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } */\ncan become\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ 000 } */\nif an extract occurs. A drain may then cause { state = 001 } to become { state = 000 }. But note that a drain can only follow an extract, so the predicate\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 001 } */\ncannot occur. Applying the possible occurrences of extract-drain-pull, we have the following potential predicate that can occur due to an asynchronous Sink following the Source push:\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 }                   ∨ */ \n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 000 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 010 ) }   */\nThis is a “stable” predicate, meaning there are no other possible states that could occur due to asynchronous Sink actions.\n\n\nThe final state of the push operation will also be the initial state prior to inject. If we begin there and apply the state changes that would be caused by inject and fill (along with the asynchronous Sink), we arrive at the following complete proof outline for the Source:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 }                   ∨ */ \n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 000 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 010 ) }   */\n\n     inject: items[0] ← 1\n\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 100 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 101 ∨ items = 100 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ items = 110 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 111 ∨ items = 110 ) }   */\n\n     fill: state[0] ← 1\n\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 }                   ∨ */ \n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 000 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 010 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 100 ∧ items = 100 }                   ∨ */ \n     /* { state = 101 ∧ ( items = 101 ∨ items = 100 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 110 ∧ items = 110 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ ( items = 111 ∨ items = 110 ) }   */\n\n     push: 〈 await ¬{ state = 111 } \n\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 }                   ∨ */ \n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 000 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ items = 010 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 010 ) }   */\n   }\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply a similar process to derive the Sink proof outline. In this case, we begin with the system state immediately following the pull operation, which is ¬{ state = 000 }. The pull operation will also move the items, in similar fashion to push above, i.e.:\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ items = 011 } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 111 }   */\nNow we consider the changes to this state that may occur due to asynchronous operation of the Source, i.e., inject, fill, and/or push. Given the operations shown above, we can see that the predicate\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ items = 001 } */\ncan become\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 101 } */\nif an inject occurs.\nA fill will cause { state = 001 } to become { state = 101 }. But note that a fill can only follow an inject, so the predicate\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 001 } */\ncannot occur. Applying the possible occurrences of inject-fill-push, we have the following potential states that can occur due to an asynchronous Source following the Sink pull:\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 101 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 111 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 111 }                     */\nThese are stable states, meaning there are no other possible states that could occur due to the Source.\n\n\n\nEvolving the states from there based on operations of the Sink and taking into account asynchronous operations of the Source we obtain the following proof outline:\n   while (not done) {\n\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ ( items = 000 ∨ items = 100 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 101 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ ( items = 010 ∨ items = 110 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 111 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 100 ∧ items = 100 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 110 ∧ items = 110 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 111 }                     */\n\n     pull: 〈 await ¬{ state = 000 } :\n\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 101 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 111 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 111 }                     */\n\n     extract: extract: item[2] ← 0\n\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 000 ∨ items = 100 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 010 ∨ items = 110 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 100 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 110 }                     */\n\n     drain: state[2] ← 0\n\n     /* { state = 000 ∧ ( items = 000 ∨ items = 100 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 001 ∧ ( items = 001 ∨ items = 101 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 010 ∧ ( items = 010 ∨ items = 110 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 011 ∧ ( items = 011 ∨ items = 111 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 100 ∧ items = 100 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 101 ∧ items = 101 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 110 ∧ items = 110 }                   ∨ */\n     /* { state = 111 ∧ items = 111 }                     */\n   }\n\n\n\nAs with the unbuffered case, the the buffered proof outlines shows the same important characteristics of the port state machine.\n\nIf we begin with the valid state { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 } (which is the only sensible state with which to begin), the state machine will never enter any BAD state. We define a BAD state to be any of the following:\n\n\npredicate with { items = 1x0 ∨ items = 1x1 } prior to inject\npredicate with { state = 1x0 ∨ state = 1x1 } prior to fill\npredicate with { items = 0x0 ∨ items = 1x0 } prior to extract\npredicate with { state = 0x0 ∨ state = 1x0 } prior to drain\n\n\nIf we begin with the valid state { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 }, and use the following steps for the Source\n  inject\n  fill\n  push\nThe Source will always be ready to accept an item for injection. Hence we do not have to check whether the Source is ready prior to invoking inject. No concurrent Sink action will change the state into one that is BAD prior to inject.\nSimilarly, if we begin with the valid state { state = 000 ∧ items = 000 } and use the following steps for the Sink\n  pull\n  extract\n  drain\nThere will always be an item ready to extract after pull completes.\nThere are no race conditions between inject and fill, nor between extract and drain. Concurrent actions from the Sink cannot cause a BAD state between inject and fill, nor can concurrent actions from the Source introduce a BAD state between extract and drain.\nIn fact, there are no race conditions between any of the steps in the Source or the Sink. As a result, we do not need to introduce any locking mechanism to make any pairs of actions atomic. (As a reminder, all actions executed by the state machine are atomic.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more detail, we can describe the Source behavior (including proof outline predicates).

The allowable Sink actions at any point must have the same predicate at the point where the Sink action occurs. For example, the predicate prior to Source inject includes { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 }, which is also a predicate prior to extract. Thus, extract could also occur prior to inject. We can therefore include the predicate resulting from the extract action as part of the predicate prior to inject. Applying allowable Sink actions in this fashion to all of the Source predicates, we obtain:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } */\n\n        /* extract: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 00 } */\n        /* drain: { state = 01 ∧ items = 00 } → { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } */\n        /* pull: no change\n\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } */\n     inject: items[0] ← 1\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) } */\n\n        /* extract: { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 10 } */\n        /* drain: { state = 01 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } */\n        /* pull: no change\n\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) } */\n     fill: state[0] ← 1\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) } */\n\n        /* extract: { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 } → { state = 11 ∧ items = 10 } */\n        /* drain: { state = 11 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } */\n        /* pull: { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } */\n        /* pull+extract: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 00 } */\n        /* pull+extract+drain: { state = 01 ∧ items = 00 } → { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } */\n\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } ∨ */\n     /* { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ ( items = 10 ∨ items = 11 ) } */\n     push: 〈 await ¬{ state = 11 } :\n              if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 01 ) } */\n   }\n\n\n\nApplying the same process to the Sink proof outline as we did for the Source proof outline:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } */\n\n       /* inject: { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } → { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 }\n       /* inject+fill: { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }\n       /* inject+fill+push: { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 }\n       /* inject+fill+push+inject: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 }\n       /* inject+fill+push+inject+fill: { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 } → { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }\n\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } ∨  */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) }  */\n     pull: 〈 await ¬{ state = 00 } :\n              if { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } ⟩\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) } */\n\n       /* inject: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 } */\n       /* fill: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 } */\n       /* push: no change \n\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) } */\n     extract: extract: item[1] ← 0\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 01 ) } */\n\n       /* inject: { state = 01 ∧ items = 00 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 10 } */\n       /* fill: { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 } → { state = 11 ∧ items = 10 } */\n       /* push: no change \n\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 01 ) } */\n     drain: state[1] ← 0  \n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 01 ) } */\n\n       /* inject: { state = 00 ∧ items = 00 } → { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 }\n       /* inject+fill: { state = 00 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 }\n       /* inject+fill+push: { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 }\n       /* inject+fill+push+inject: { state = 01 ∧ items = 01 } → { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 }\n       /* inject+fill+push+inject+fill: { state = 01 ∧ items = 11 } → { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 }\n\n     /* { state = 00 ∧ ( items = 00 ∨ items = 10 ) } ∨ { state = 10 ∧ items = 10 } ∨  */\n     /* { state = 01 ∧ ( items = 01 ∨ items = 11 ) } ∨ { state = 11 ∧ items = 11 ) }  */\n   }\n\n\n\nSummarizing the proof outlines above (including only the relevant predicates), we obtain the proof outlines below.

    "text": "A task graph node is a computational unit that applies user-provided functions to data flowing through the graph. Data flows through the graph (and through the nodes) via task graph ports. A function node takes input data from its input port, applies a user-defined function and creates output data on its output port. A producer node only creates output; a consumer node only takes input. Output ports from one node connect to the input ports of another via an edge. A simple node takes one piece of data and produces on piece of data for each input. A simple MIMO node may take multiple inputs and produce multiple outputs; it creates its outputs using one piece of data from each input.\n\n\n\nsimple_node\n\n\n\n\n\nmimo_node\n\n\nAPI\n\n****Note:*** Based on feedback from Isaiah, the following updated API is proposed. The current API will be updated to reflect this new one over the course of the current sprint.*\n\n\n\n\n\ntemplate <class Item>\nclass ProducerNode;\n\nItem the type of data to be produced by the ProducerNode\n\n\n\n  template <class Function>\n  ProducerNode(Function&& f);\n\nFunction must meet the requirements of std::function<Item())> or of std::function<Item(std::stop_source))>.\nIf the latter constructor is used, a stop_source variable is passed to the enclosed function. If the enclosed function invokes stop_source::request_stop(), the ProducerNode will enter the stopping state, which will propagate throught its output port to the connected input port. The connected node will the enter its shutdown state, and so on, thus stopping computation throughout the entire task graph.\nClass Template Argument Deduction (CTAD) guides have been specified so that explicit template arguments are not required to construct objects with the above constructor. The CTAD guides work in the cases where Function is a regular function, a lambda, or a function object. The current CTAD guides do not work when Function is a bind object; a template argument is still required in the case of std::bind.\nNote that in the case of a lambda, the unary + operator is required to decay the lambda into a normal function.\n\n\n\n\n\n    // Create a `ProducerNode` with a function\n    size_t source_function(std::stop_source &);\n    auto a = ProducerNode {source_function};\n\n    // Nodes can also be created with function objects\n    class source_function_object {\n      size_t operator()(std::stop_source &);\n    }\n    source_function_object f;\n    auto b = ProducerNode {f};\n\n    // And with lambdas.  IMPORTANT: Note the unary `+`!\n    auto c = ProducerNode {+[]() { return 0UL; }};\n\n    // Bind requires specifying node type (so it seems)\n    auto g = std::bind([](double i) ->size_t { return 0UL;}, 0.0);\n    auto d = ProducerNode<size_t> (bb);\n\n    // Emulating bind will work, not requiring template type\n    size_t bind_function(double) { return 0UL; }\n    auto e = ProducerNode(+[]() -> size_t { return bind_function(0.0); });\n\nNote: Future enhancements to the API will include variants to support one-shot or multi-shot (for a specified number of runs) operation, with an implicit stop following execution. Using one-shot or multi-shot variants will obviate the need for the user to invoke the stop_source.\n\nIn the following, we omit all of the variations for creating different kinds of nodes. But it should be understood that all the constructor variants may be used for the node types below.\n\n\n\ntemplate <class Item>\nclass ConsumerNode;\n\nItem the type of data to be produced by the ConsumerNode\n\n\n\n  template <class Function>\n  ProducerNode(Function&& f);\n  - `Function` must meet the requirements of `std::function<void(const Item&)>`.\n\n\n\n\n    void sink_function(const size_t&);\n    Consumer Node b{sink_function};\n\n\n\ntemplate <class InItem, class OutItem = InItem>\nclass FunctionNode;\n\nInItem the type of data to be consumed on the input of the FunctionNode\nOutItem the type of data to be created on the output of the FunctionNode\n\n\n\n  template <class Function>\n  ProducerNode(Function&& f);\n\nFunction must meet the requirements of std::function<OutItem(const InItem&)>.\n\n\n\n\n    size_t function(const size_t&);\n    FunctionNode b{function};\n\n\n\n\ntemplate <\n    template <class> class SinkMover, class...

The type of the Mover must still be explicitly specified.\n\nNote: When connecting an output port to an input port, the Item types of the input port, output port, and edge must be the same.\n\n\n\nProducerNode a{source_function{}};\nConsumerNode b{sink_function{}};\n\nEdge<AsyncMover3> e{a, b};\n\ndouble other_source_function() {\n  return 0.0;\n}\n\nProducerNode c {other_source_function{}};\nConsumerNode d{sink_function{}};\n\nEdge<AsyncMover3> f{c, d};  // This will fail to compile because Item types of Producer and Consumer don't match.\n\nIf we decide to use the same type of Edge throughout a given graph, we can make a type alias such as\n\ntemplate <class Item>\nusing GraphEdge = Edge<AsyncMover3, Item>;\nin which case we could simply invoke\nProducerNode a{source_function{}};\nConsumerNode b{sink_function{}};\n\nGraphEdge e{a, b};\n\n(Note that AsyncMover3 is itself a type alias, using some specific types given to the more general ItemMover class. This will likely be further generalized to include a Scheduler. However, since a given graph will use a specified scheduler, we can likely hide this behind type aliases and specific types for certain template parameters. In general, users will not need to see the Scheduler type in the API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass Scheduler;\n\nBase class for schedulers.\n\n\n\nScheduler(size_t concurrency_level = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();\n\n\n\ntemplate <class... Tasks>\nScheduler::submit(Tasks&&... tasks);\n\nSubmits tasks to scheduler\nNote: Task execution is lazy. Tasks do not begin execution until a wait function is called.\n\n\n\n\ntemplate <class... Tasks>\nScheduler::sync_wait_all();\n\nSynchronously wait for tasks to complete.\nNote: Task execution is lazy. Tasks previously submitted to submit will be launched on calling sync_wait_all()\n\n\n\n\nSee also full example below;\n// Define nodes\nProducerNode a;\nConsumerNode b;\n\n// Connect nodes\nEdge {a, b};\n\nBountifulScheduler sched;\n\n// Submit jobs\nsched.submit(a, b);\n\n// Wait on their completion\nsched.sync_wait_all();\n\n\n\nA node is repeatedly run until it is stopped. It is expected that a simple node will produce one data item each time it is run. Suppose we wish to have a ProducerNode that generates a finite sequence of numbers. Consider the following.\nsize_t source_function_1(std::stop_source& stop_source) {\n  for (size_t i = 0; i < 42; ++i) {\n    return i;\n  }\n  stop_source.request_stop();\n  return 0UL;\n}\nsource_function_1 src_1;\nauto a = ProducerNode { src_1; );\nThis node will not produce the desired result. Each time it is called, it will return 10. Moreover, it will never invoke request_stop().\nA correctly behaving function would be something like\nsize_t source_function_2(std::stop_source& stop_source) {\n  static i = 0;\n  if (i < 42) {\n    return i++;\n  }\n  stop_source.request_stop();\n  return 0UL;\n}\nsource_function_2 src_2;\nauto a = ProducerNode { src_2; );\nHere. we make i static so that its value is saved across invocations of the node. It will generate numbers from 0 to 41 and then stop. (Again note that the value returned after request_stop() is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// This function object generates a sequence of numbers up to a specified limit\n// (non-inclusive), aftter which it invokes `std::stop_source::request_stop()`.\n// The stop will propagate and shut down the rest of the nodes. (The stop will\n// essentially propagate behind the data items in flight.  All of the\n// data items will complete transmission through the graph and all nodes\n// will continue to run until the data items are exhausted.\nclass source_function {\n public:\n  size_t operator()(std::stop_source& stopper) {\n    static size_t i = 0;\n    if (i < 42) {\n      return i++;\n    stopper.request_stop();\n    return 0UL;\n  }\n};\n\n// Function object to transform data items\n// This trivial function simply propagates its input to its output\ntemplate <class InItem = size_t, class OutItem = InItem>\nclass function {\n public:\n  OutItem operator()(const InItem& in) {\n    return in;\n  }\n};\n\n// Sink function object to absorb data items\ntemplate <class Item = size_t>\nclass sink_function {\n public:\n  void operator()(Item) {\n  }\n};\n\n// Function to generate items.  Generates a sequence of numbers until a \n// limit is reached, at which point a stop is requested.

The return value is ignored and\n  // not sent into the graph\n  return 0;\n}\n\n\n\n// Create nodes\nProducerNode a{actual_source_function};\nFunctionNode b{function{}};\nFunctionNode c{[](size_t i) ( return i; };\nConsumerNode d{sink_function{}};\n\n\n\n// Connect a to b\nEdge f{a, b};\n\n// Connect b to c\nEdge g{b, c};\n\n// Connect c to d\nEdge h{c, d};\n\n\n\n// Run the primitive graph\nBountifulScheduler sched;  // Could also use throw_catchSchedular\n\n// Until we have an actual `graph` class, we can submit a primitive\n// graph for execution by submitting its nodes\nsched.submit(a, b, c, d);\n\n// Wait on completion of the graph's execution\nsched.sync_wait_all();\n\n\n\nWe can also emulate a bountiful scheduler, where we run each node inside of an asynchronous task. The run member function of a node invokes the node continually until stop is invoked.\n\n// Task to invoke `ProducerNode a`.  Invoke stop after `rounds` iterations.\nauto fun_a = [&]() {\n  a.run();\n};\n\n// Task to invoke `FunctionNode b`.  Run until stopped.\nauto fun_b = [&]() {\n  b.run();\n};\n\n// Task to invoke `ConsumerNode c`.  Run until stopped.\nauto fun_c = [&]() {\n  c.run();\n};\n\n// Task to invoke `ConsumerNode c`.  Run until stopped.\nauto fun_d = [&]() {\n  d.run();\n};\n\nauto fut_a = std::async(std::launch::async, fun_a);\nauto fut_b = std::async(std::launch::async, fun_b);\nauto fut_c = std::async(std::launch::async, fun_c);\nauto fut_d = std::async(std::launch::async, fun_d);\n\n// Wait for completion\nfut_a.get();\nfut_b.get();\nfut_c.get();\nfut_d.get();\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea of the updated API is to allow task graph nodes to be created with following simplified syntax:\n  template <class Item>\n  class ProducerNode;\n  auto node = ProducerNode{function};\nwhere function is an appropriately defined function for execution in the task graphs. Note that the template parameter for ProducerNode does not have to be explicitly specified. Rather, it is deduced (via a library-defined deduction rule) from the type of function.\nThe previous API for task graph nodes was\n  template <template <class> class Mover, class Item>\n  class ProducerNode;\n  auto node = ProducerNode{function};\nwhich would require the Mover type to be specified (Item could still be deduced). There are two ways to achieve the simplified API. One, as above, is to define task graph nodes as taking only one interface, and allowing the Mover to be an abstract base class within the node class, which would be set when the Edge connects two nodes. This will add a small bit of overhead to each call to the Mover, which may or may not be significant. There is also a slight entanglement of all of the node classes with the Mover class (a slight lessening of the separation of concerns). In the templated case, the node classes do not need to “know” about the Mover class until instantiation time.\nWith the templated API, the Mover does not need to be an abstract base class. To eliminate having to specify the Mover at each node instantiation, we could do something like the following: The previous API for task graph nodes was\n  template <template <class> class Mover, class Item>\n  class GraphProducerNode;\n\n  template <class Item>\n  using ProducerNode = GraphProducerNode<DefaultMover, Item>;\n\n  auto node = ProducerNode{function};\nHere, DefaultMover is a concrete class. With this approach, if one wanted to used different types of concrete Mover classes, one would need define type aliases for different instantiations with the GraphProducerNode.\nAll in all, the first approach (using Mover as an abstract base class) seems to be the cleanest and will be the approach taken. The task graph API will be revised accordingly."

The following notes are intended to help you file issues, bug reports, or contribute code to the open source TileDB project.\n\n\n\nReporting a bug? Please read how to file a bug report section to make sure sufficient information is included.\nContributing code? You rock! Be sure to review the contributor section for helpful tips on the tools we use to build TileDB, format code, and issue pull requests (PR)’s.\n\n\n\n\nA useful bug report filed as a GitHub issue provides information about how to reproduce the error.\n\nBefore opening a new GitHub issue try searching the existing issues to see if someone else has already noticed the same problem.\nWhen filing a bug report, provide where possible:\n\n\nThe version TileDB (tiledb_version()) or if a dev version, specific commit that triggers the error.\nThe full error message, including the backtrace (if possible). Verbose error reporting is enabled by building TileDB with ../bootstrap --enable-verbose.\nA minimal working example, i.e. the smallest chunk of code that triggers the error. Ideally, this should be code that can be a small reduced C / C++ source file. If the code to reproduce is somewhat long, consider putting it in a gist.\n\n\nWhen pasting code blocks or output, put triple backquotes (```) around the text so GitHub will format it nicely. Code statements should be surrounded by single backquotes (`). See GitHub’s guide on Markdown for more formatting tricks.\n\n\n\n\nBy contributing code to TileDB, you are agreeing to release it under the MIT License.\n\n\nPlease see building from source for dependencies and detailed build instructions.\nFrom a fork of TileDB\ngit clone https://github.com/username/TileDB\ncd TileDB && mkdir build && cd build\n../bootstrap\nmake && make check\ncd ../\ngit checkout -b <my_initials>/<my_bugfix_branch>\n... code changes ...\nmake -C build format\nmake -C build check\ngit commit -a -m \"my commit message\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin <my_initials>/<my_bugfix_branch>\nIssue a PR from your updated TileDB fork\nBranch conventions: - dev is the development branch of TileDB, all PR’s are merged into dev. - master tracks the latest stable / released version of TileDB. - release-x.y.z are major / bugfix release branches of TileDB.\nFormatting conventions: - 2 spaces per indentation level not tabs - class names use CamelCase - member functions, variables use lowercase with underscores - class member variables use a trailing underscore foo_ - comments are good, TileDB uses doxygen for class doc strings. - format code using clang-format\n\n\n\n\ndev is the development branch, all PR’s should be rebased on top of the latest dev commit.\nCommit changes to a local branch. The convention is to use your initials to identify branches: (ex. “Fred Jones” , fj/my_bugfix_branch). Branch names should be identifiable and reflect the feature or bug that they want to address / fix. This helps in deleting old branches later.\nMake sure the test suite passes by running make check.\nWhen ready to submit a PR, git rebase the branch on top of the latest dev commit. Be sure to squash / cleanup the commit history so that the PR preferably one, or a couple commits at most. Each atomic commit in a PR should be able to pass the test suite.\nRun the limiting / code format tooling (make format) before submitting a final PR. Make sure that your contribution generally follows the format and naming conventions used by surrounding code.\nIf the PR changes/adds/removes user-facing API or system behavior (such as API changes), add a note to the TileDB/HISTORY.md file.\nSubmit a PR, writing a descriptive message. If a PR closes an open issue, reference the issue in the PR message (ex. If an issue closes issue number 10, you would write closes #10)\nMake sure CI (continuous integration) is passing for your PR – click Show all checks in the pull request status box at the bottom of each PR page.

    "text": "The legacy of C is that functions have only a single return and only return by value. When a function should naturally return multiple return values, it was expedient to pass “out-arguments” to the function. In C this was a pointer; in C++ it could also be a reference. This convention commingled in- and out-arguments in a call list. C++17 can do better.\n\nUsestd::tuple to return multiple values.\nStrictly speaking, returning multiple values was possible before. The overhead required was burdensome. A function could return a struct value, packaging multiple values as a single one. std::tuple allows something like an in-place struct declaration; the elements are typed but anonymous. Such a function is still returning a single value, but of a type that’s designed to hold multiples.\nUse std::optional to return a value that might not be initialized.\nA near-universal pattern is to return a value when a function succeeds but not to return anything when it fails. This is the pattern when a function throws on failure. If it should not throw on failure, though, it has to return both a success/failure status and sometimes a value. std::optional is the standard library’s way of representing “sometimes a value”. The “not this time” value is std::nullopt.\nThere’s an alternative return value that this style guide considers an antipattern: a default-constructed instance. Of all the problems it has, the most pernicious is that is discourages adherence to “C.41: A constructor should create a fully initialized object”. It’s less efficient, too, since it requires an extraneous construction and assignment. The present style guide enables direct-initialization with no run-time overhead.\nUse std::optional even for bool-convertible classes like shared_ptr.\nYes, it’s certainly possible to use an a empty shared_ptr to signify a “pointer that’s not present”. A consistent return convention makes it quicker to read code. Please don’t put your colleagues in the position of needing to figure out that you’re doing something different to accomplish something that’s not different.\nRemember the std::in_place_t form of the std::optional constructor.\nAs a rule, it’s more efficient to construct an object immediately before you need it. When returning an optional, that’s the return statement. The in_place argument to optional<T> allows its constructor to also construct the T instance, removing any need for a temporary or extraneous variable.\nPrefer a structured binding declaration to initialize variables.\nStructured binding, introduced in C++17, allows multiple assignment or multiple initialization from tuples (or from other types that can act like tuples). While it’s the preferred way of retrieving return values, it’s not the only way.\nThe easiest alternative is auto x{f(...)};. This statement initializes x as a tuple. The disadvantage is that elements have to be retrieved by position. A structured binding declaration allows elements to be retrieved by name. A tuple variable is perfectly good, though, when the value is being forwarded on.\nAnother alternative is to use std::tie to assign to existing variables. This can be better in circumstances where it’s beneficial to reuse an existing variable.\nPrefer structured direct-initialization over structured assignment.\nOne of the forms of structured binding looks like an assignment; it performs copy-initialization. The other forms perform direct-initialization. The direct form is more general and more efficient that the copy form. (The copy form might be needed in unusual circumstances.) In particular, direct-initialization works with non-copyable classes.\nAlso, use the curly-brace syntax for direct-initialization. There’s a parenthesis syntax available, but its easily confused at a glance with the lambda syntax.\nBy default, use the && ref-qualifier in a structured binding.\nRoughly speaking, the && ref-qualifier yields perfect forwarding, as if the structured variables had been directly initialized in the return statement of the function.\nIf the structured variables should all be constant, then const auto& may be appropriate, and the rules for temporary materialization will apply. The structured binding syntax does not allow mixed declarations with both const and non-const variables, as the cv-declaration is about the temporary value (the right side, roughly) rather than to the variables.\nCheck that a returned class has a move constructor.\nThis point is about efficiency. If a move constructor is not present, the compiler will use the copy constructor. The default move constructor will typically suffice.\n\n\n\n\nDeclare as tuple<boolean_like, optional<T>> f(...)\nInitialize as auto && [b, t]{ f(...) };\nMove constructor T(T&&) = default;\n\n\n\n\n#include <optional>\n\nclass NC {\n  int x;\n  int y;\n public:\n  NC() = delete;\n  explicit NC(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {};\n  NC(const NC&) = delete; // No copy constructor\n  NC(NC&&) = default;  // ... but there is a move constructor\n  int operator()() const { return x; }\n};\n\nstd::tuple<bool, std::optional<NC>> foo() {\n  return {true,std::optional<NC>( std::in_place, 1, 3 )};\n}\n\nstd::tuple<bool, std::optional<NC>> bar() {\n  return {false, std::nullopt};\n}\n\nTEST_CASE(\"foo\")\n{\n  auto && [b, nc]{ foo() };\n  CHECK(b);\n  REQUIRE(nc.has_value());\n  CHECK((*nc)() == 1);\n}\n\nTEST_CASE(\"bar\")\n{\n  auto && [b, nc]{ bar() };\n  CHECK_FALSE(b);\n  CHECK_FALSE(nc.has_value());\n}"

Use exceptions, not Status objects, for errors.\nValidate all types either at time of deserialization or in the constructor used for generating the object.\nAdd unit tests that check the validations throws the expected errors.\n\n\n\nFor validating enums, consider creating a function that converts from the underlying variable type to the enum with validation. The serialization/deserialization should be to an fixed-size integer of the under-lying type. Consider writing a function with validation to get the actual enum from the integer. For example,\ninline ArrayType array_type_from_int(uint8_t array_type_enum) {\n    auto type = ArrayType(array_type_enum);\n    if (type != ArrayType::DENSE && type != ArrayType::SPARSE) {\n        throw std::runtime_error(\n            \"Invalid ArrayType (\" + std::to_string(array_type_enum) + \")\");\n    }\n    return type;\n}\nIf the enum has many types, use a switch statement to validate the types."

    "text": "All functions\n\nEvery function should signal an error only when it gives up what it’s trying to do.\n\nThis point may sound obvious, but it’s a bit more subtle than that. The magic word is only. A function that is unable to do something but knows that it can’t could return a bool value of false, for example. A function that can’t tell whether it can do something or not needs to signal an error.\nAnother way of stating this point is that signalling an error isn’t the same thing as failing an operation. If a function only ever succeeds at its operation, then it must signal an error. If a function can both succeed and fail at its operation, then it need not signal an error. Yet it’s also possible for a function to both succeed and fail and also stop working and throw an error.\nIt’s up to the function to determine when it should fail (ordinary, without error) and when it should signal an error (not ordinary). The decision about whether or not to do this is not a matter of style, but of substance.\n\nA function should signal an error only when circumstances are outside its expectations.\n\nSome code might be described as whimsical, unexpectedly not performing the duties they seem to have taken on. (It might be appropriate to refer to these as Bartelby functions, because they would prefer not to perform certain tasks.) This point is that a function should be consistent in its error behavior.\n\nEach function should document its expectations.\n\nA user of a function should have some idea about when it may rely upon the behavior of a function. If the function does not contain documentation about what its expectations are, a user cannot know with precision when it may be relied upon.\nAn expection is somewhat broader than a precondition. All preconditions are expectations, to be sure. Some expectations, though, are not. For example, an expectation about the state of a filesystem might be present. If so, however, it should be documented. There should be no implicit expectations.\n\nSignal an error by returning an error status.\n\nAs of now, this code signals error by returning an object of class Status.\nThis advice is will evolve. The first change will be “Signal an either by returning an error status or throwing”. The second will be “Signal an error by throwing”."

In this case there are no chunk metadata bytes (since there are no filters to add metadata), and the filtered bytes are the same as original bytes.\nThe “chunk metadata” before the actual “chunk filtered data” depend on the particular sequence of filters in the pipeline. In the simple case, each filter will simply concatenate its metadata to the chunk metadata region. Because some filters in the pipeline may wish to filter the metadata of previous filters (e.g. compression, where it is beneficial to compress previous filters’ metadata in addition to the actual chunk data), the ordering of filters also impacts the metadata that is eventually written to disk.\nThe “chunk filtered data” bytes contain the final bytes of the chunk after being passed through the entire pipeline. When reading tiles from disk, the filter pipeline is run in the reverse order.\nInternally, any filter in a filter pipeline produces two arrays of data as output: a metadata byte array and a filtered data byte array. Additionally, these output byte arrays can be arbitrarily separated into “parts” by any filter. Typically, when a next filter receives the output of the previous filter as its input, it will filter each “part” independently.\n\nByteshuffle Filter\nThe byteshuffle filter does not filter input metadata, and the output data is guaranteed to be the same length as the input data.\nThe byteshuffle filter produces output metadata in the format:\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNumber of parts\nuint32_t\nNumber of data parts\n\n\nLength of part 1\nuint32_t\nNumber of bytes in data part 1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nLength of part N\nuint32_t\nNumber of bytes in data part N\n\n\n\nThe byteshuffle filter produces output data in the format:\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nuint8_t[]\nByteshuffled data part 1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPart N\nuint8_t[]\nByteshuffled data part N\n\n\n\n\n\nBitshuffle Filter\nThe bitshuffle filter does not filter input metadata.

There are two situations when these files are added. The first one is when a user decides to improve the open performance of their array (by reducing the listing size) through commits consolidation. The second one is when a user has specified a maximum fragment size for consolidation and multiple fragments needed to be committed at once, this file format will be used so that an atomic file system operation can be performed to do so.\nWhen fragments that are included inside of a consolidated file are removed, either through vacuuming or other fragment deletion, an ignore file needs to be written so that those commits file can be ignored when opening an array and not cause unnecessary file system operations.\nThere are three types of objects that can be in the file: commits, deletes or updates. For each of those, the first field is the URI of the object, which determines the subsequent serialized content of the data block: - a URI ending with .ok or .wrt is a commit object containing only the fragment URI - a URI ending with .del is a delete object containing the serialized delete condition - a URI ending with .upd is an update object containing the serialized update condition\n\nFragment commit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCommit URI followed by a new line character\nuint8_t[]\n.ok, .wrt\nURI\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete commit (see delete commit file for the format of the serialized delete condition):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nURI followed by a new line character\nuint8_t[]\n.del\nURI\n\n\nSerialized delete condition tile size\nuint64_t\n\nDelete condition tile size\n\n\nSerialized delete condition tile\nuint8_t[]\n\nDelete condition tile\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate commit (see update commit file for the format of the serialized update condition):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nURI followed by a new line character\nuint8_t[]\n.upd\nURI\n\n\nSerialized update condition tile size\nuint64_t\n\nUpdate condition tile size\n\n\nSerialized update condition tile\nuint8_t[]\n\nUpdate condition tile"

The colorspace format can be configured for this filter by setting the TILEDB_WEBP_INPUT_FORMAT filter option. Tile-based compression is determined by dimension extents. Extents equal to dimension bounds will compress the image in one pass.\nFor attributes, the WebP filter supports only the uint8_t data type. Dimension data types can be any two matching integral types, such as {uint32_t, uint32_t} or {int64_t, int64_t} for example.\n# Data from 2x3 pixel image\ninput = [[255,62,83, 149,43,67, 138,43,67]\n         [255,62,83, 149,43,67, 138,43,67]]\n# Ingest and read with lossless compression\noutput = [[255,62,83, 149,43,67, 138,43,67]\n          [255,62,83, 149,43,67, 138,43,67]]\n# Ingest and read with lossy compression\noutput = [[251,60,84, 148,51,61, 142,42,64]\n          [252,63,85, 150,46,67, 139,44,68]]\nThe figure below from WebP API documentation may help to understand the format of data passed to and read from the WebP filter.\n\nPhoto by Google licensed under CC BY 4.0\nUsing the figure above from WebP API documentation, height should correspond with dimension 0 upper bound, while stride corresponds with dimension 1 upper bound. The pixel width of the image is internally calculated based on colorspace format and tile extents.\nTile extents are used to configure tile-based compression. We should note that the maximum WebP image size is 16383x16383. Because of this, our extents can not exceed 16383 for dimension 0, and 16383 * pixel_depth for dimension 1. pixel_depth is defined by our colorspace format selection. RGB and BGR images have a depth of 3, while RGBA and BGRA have a depth of 4 for the additional alpha value provided for each pixel.\n\nFilter Enum Value\nThe filter enum value for the WEBP filter is 17 (TILEDB_FILTER_WEBP enum).\n\n\nInput and Output Layout\nInput is a single array of colorspace values in RGB, BGR, RGBA, or BGRA format. For RGB format we would expect the first pixel to store R, G, B values at input[0], input[1], and input[2] respectively, followed by the remaining pixels in the image. Ingesting a 10x10 image would expect 300 total input values for 10 rows of 30 colorspace values per-row.\nOutput is organized the same as input. If we compress an image with lossless enabled, all outputs match inputs exactly. If we instead use lossy compression with a quality of 0, output colorspace values will vary due to data lost during lossy WebP compression but the organization of the data remains the same."

    "text": "The float scale filter converts floating point type data to integer data after first shifting and scaling the data. It is a lossy filter that is often used in combination with other filters that perform well on integer data. The float scale filter stores its input data (with floating point type) as integer values for more compressed storage. For example, given data as a NumPy float64 array, with scale/offset parameters, and a specified byte width of 4: ``` data = np.random.rand(npts) data_b = data.view(np.float64) new_data_b = np.zeros(npts, dtype=np.int32) # byte width is 4 scale, offset\nfor i in range(0, len(data)): # round works like ’s round new_data_b[i] = round((data_b[i] - offset) / scale) ```\nOn read, the float scaling filter will reverse the scale factor and offset, restoring the original floating point data, with a potential loss of precision. Given the previous example: restored_data = np.zeros(npts, dtype=np.float64)    for i in range(0, len(data)):      restored_data[i] = (new_data_b[i] * scale) + offset\nHere’s a small example of the float scaling filter’s behavior on write, then read. Given the parameters scale = 0.25, offset = 10.0, and byte_size = 2, this is how the data is stored and retrieved.\n  input_data (double) = [10.0, 10.2500, 10.7540, 11.0001]\n  stored_data (16 bit integer) = [0, 1, 3, 4]\n  output_data (double) = [10.0, 10.2500, 10.7500, 11.0]\n\n\nThe filter enum value for the float scaling filter is 15 (TILEDB_FILTER_SCALE_FLOAT enum).\n\n\n\nThe input data layout will be an array of floating point numbers.

Both fixed-sized and var-sized attributes can be nullable.

In many cases this will be to throw StatusException instead of returning an error Status, but not in all cases. In some cases a bool may be an appropriate return. In others there might be (or might be created) a semantically appropriate return type that distinguishes between different kinds of failure condititions.\nThere is no particular urgency to this goal. The code has used Status for years. This change is not being made to solve any particular technical defect.\n\n\n\nElimination of code-junk macros RETURN_NOT_OK and their ilk. Error handling is fundamental. It can’t be avoided; it must be faced. In C++ there’s a basic choice to use exceptions or to use return values. There’s syntactic overhead with both. The choice is between try statements with exceptions and return-if-return statements otherwise.\nUsing try statement syntactically marks off error handling code to readily identifiable blocks. Using if statements (or a macro encapsulation) intermixes code for each possible failure in with the code that might fail. Since most failures are rare-to-nonexistent, particularly possible logic errors, try statements end up with code that is far easier to read.\nPromotion of RAII and C.41. When there’s a policy of avoiding exceptions, constructors can’t throw to enforce class invariants. This means that having class invariants requires private constructors and dedicated factory functions in all cases. Of course it’s easier not to do this, which leads to the practice of not defining class invariants. This bypasses the benefits of RAII and obviates the utility of C.41 compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass StatusException is available for use. Functions that currently return Status but only do so to signal logic errors are immediate candidates for conversion.\nStatus factory classes are still defined in status.h. Prior to beginning this goal, class Status contained a number of member functions to create Status objects with designated origins. These functions required global declaration where local declaration would have been more appropriate. These functions are still declared in status.h but only because the task of moving all the declarations to more appropriate source files has not yet started.\nStatus still has its legacy implementation pattern. Status is due for one more rewrite. Its current internals can be replaced with a single member variable of type optional<StatusException>."

    "text": "The C API consists of layers starting with the API functions themselves and ending with classes that call into the non-API parts of the core library. There are five layers, each with its own responsibilities.\n\n\nPublic API functions themselves are declared with extern \"C\" linkage. They are implemented as wrappers around an API implementation function. There is a one-to-one relationship between public API functions and API implementation functions.\nPublic API functions are responsible for uniform error processing through handling exceptions. The wrapper provides uniformity of behavior for (1) return values, (2) logging format, (3) error return. Non-uniform error handling may be done outside this layer, although that’s not usually necessary.\n\n\n\nAPI implementation functions translate C calling sequences into C++ calling sequences. At the foundation is translating between C-style pointers and C++ objects. This is sometimes much more than simple argument translation. This translation may require conversion between the differing lifespans of core objects and API-visible objects that allow access to them. Different classes may be used to represent the same kind of core object, depending on life cycle; API implementation functions are responsible for selecting the correct one.\nThese functions are the first line for argument validation. They have principal responsibility for the ways that argument may be invalid as C arguments, the most notable of which is null pointers. They have secondary responsibility for validating arguments in other ways; in these cases the underlying classes have the primary responsibility.\nThese functions have primary responsibility for memory allocation of API-visible objects. The legacy pattern was raw new and delete with explicit error recovery. The new pattern is to use a handle class. Once the conversion to handles is complete, it won’t be necessary to state that memory is a responsibility here.\n\n\n\nHandle classes manage memory allocation for API-visible objects, deriving from a generic class api:handle base class. Handle classes hide the details of memory allocation from API implementation functions\nHandles are carriers for facade instances. There’s a one-to-one relationship between a handle class and a facade base class (see below). Handle classes forward all functions used by implementation functions to the facade.\nThere’s a one-to-one relationship between handle objects and facade objects. Handles are constructed carrying facades, and facades are not created unless through a handle.\nAn API implementation function may not naively assume that an argument pointer to a C API function is a valid pointer to a handle; such an assumption constitutes a security risk. Associated with each handle type is a warehouse function (parallel to a factory function) that converts an API argument pointer into a facade pointer. At root this is simply getting the pointer value, but the warehouse function may refuse a request for an unknown object.\n[Future] Handle classes are the nexus for API object registration, a facility that keeps track of all outstanding objects obtained through the C API.\n\n\n\nFacade classes present a uniform interface to core objects regardless of the life cycle of the object. In particular, there’s a difference between newly-created objects, such as those created with *_alloc functions, and pre-existing objects, such as those retrieved from aggregates like an array schema. Thus facade classes generally derive from an abstract base class and implement them in accordance with life cycle concerns.\nThe motivation for this structure is to be able to interconvert between C.41-compliant core objects and a C.41-hostile set C API functions. Depending on lifecycle state, some operations may be prohibited. For example, array schema data is considered immutable once it’s been created, so set_* C API functions must fail on objects that have been (C.41 fully-) constructed and must succeed on “pre-construction” objects (those that have been constructed in the C API but not yet constructed in core).\nFor each facade base class, there’s an optional proxy class, that is, a {0,1} to 1 relationship. If there’s an *_alloc function in the C API, there will be a proxy class, but otherwise there need not be one.\n\n\n\nA proxy class represent a C API object that is newly created by collecting constructor arguments through API set_ calls.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to facilitate correct SWIG wrapper generation, non-TileDB headers included by the external header files must be wrapped as follows:\n#ifndef TILEDB_CAPI_WRAPPING\n#include <stdint.h>\n#endif"
